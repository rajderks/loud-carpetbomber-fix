### What does it do?

This mod aims to empower the bombing role of the Lucidity (UEF - T4 Fighter/Bomber) by actually making it throw a carpet bomb.
The bombs are somewhat randomized so each carpet will be unique.

Due to the increase in the AOE the role has changed from a single-target bomber, which it really was, to a more AOE oriented bomber.  
Damage values have been lowered so that it now hits a lot more units; T3 unit groups may require 2 to 3 runs in order to be drained of hitpoints!
